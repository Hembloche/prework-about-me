      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I currently work in sales for a publishing company & digital agency in Southern Pines, NC.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, but lived there for just over a year. I moved to right outside Erie, PA, then to Southern Pines, NC in 4th Grade. Outside of 4 years in Boone, most of my life has been lived in Southern Pines.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I have a 2 year old Husky, so most things I do revolve around her. I like to take her on walks through local parks & nature preserves. When I do have some time to myself, I usually spend it playing video games or watching movies.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job would be an astronaut. That ship has definitely sailed. Now I'm looking to begin a new career in web design & development. </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I moved to Raleigh, NC in January.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I've always been interested in anything programming related. My current job has required that I familiarize myself with developing & maintaining WordPress sites. I've found that I enjoy doing that, but definitely want to know much more than just basic WordPress.</p>
